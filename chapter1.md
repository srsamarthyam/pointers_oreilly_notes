# Introduction

Pointers provide power and flexibility

    - Used to dynamically manipulate '''memory'''
    - Enhances support for data structures
    - Enables access to hardware

Programming is concerned with manipulating data that is normally located
in memory.

So, a better understanding of how C manages memory will provide insight 
that translates to better programming

    - Program Stack
    - Heap
    - Stack Frame
    - Memory Model

Use of pointers and how memory is managed

    - Support for dynamic memory allocation
    - Closely tied to array notation
    - When used to point to functions, they add another dimension to flow 
    control in a program

Pointer is a variable that stores the address of a memory location

The key to comprehending pointers is understanding how memory is managed
in a C program.

    - Pointers
    - Pointer operators
    - How pointers interact with memory
    - Various types of '''nulls'''

The memory model used with a given compiler and operating system environment
affects how pointers are used.

# Pointers and Memory

A pointer variable contains the address in memory of another variable,
object, or function.

An object is considered to be memory allocated using one of the memory
allocation functions, such as the malloc function.
